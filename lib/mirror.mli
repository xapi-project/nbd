  (** [connect ?progress primary secondary] creates a block device which performs I/O
      against [primary], while building a mirror of [primary] on top of
      [secondary] in the background. Existing data in [secondary] will be
      destroyed.

      If [?progress_cb] is provided then it will be called on every percentage
      change in mirror progress.

      It is an error if the block size of either [primary] or [secondary]
      is not an integer multiple of the other.

      It is an error if [primary] and [secondary] have different lengths.

      It is an error if [secondary] is read-only.
